# Wheel drive robot with LiDAR

Developed a robot system as part of an engineering thesis project, consisting of two ESP-based modules and a Python Flask server. One ESP controlled motors and collected data from a gyroscope and encoders; the other handled LiDAR data acquisition and communication with the server. The server enabled robot control, visualization, and room mapping based on LiDAR measurements.

## Mapping result
Example of a room map generated by my robot:

The map was constructed using only odometry, due to time constraints, a SLAM algorithm was not implemented.

## Schematic
A high-level visualization of the electrical connections is shown below:
